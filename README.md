In this study, three different BERT-based algorithms were developed and compared in the field of text steganography. The first method is a character-based approach that embeds a single hidden character into a fixed position within each word. The second method aims to embed a fixed number of bits per word using fixed-width bit encoding, while the third method leverages Huffman coding based on prediction probabilities to enable more flexible and semantically appropriate word selection.
